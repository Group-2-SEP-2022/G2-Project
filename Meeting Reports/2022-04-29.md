Participants: Joris LEFONDEUR, Yinghan LING\
Location: Online via Discord\
Documented by Yinghan LING.
## Tasks
We tried out the capture game that Joris already made after the first sprint, and we were happy having seen it as what we imagined before. For the next week, **Joris** will proceed to make the inventory, to draw the departments and to link every elements relevant to them together. He also presented the sprites he had found to make the departments at [limezu](https://limezu.itch.io/).
## Problems & Solutions
### Problem Addressing
In the past week, we had some troubles working on the project at the same time. When we pushed something new to GitHub but the local repository is not up to date, then there would be a lot of conflicts that can only be solved in the source code of the file **`.unity`**, as shown below.![conflicts]()
These kind of conflicts are hard to solve since we do not understand the source code of **`.unity`** and do not want to cause chaos in the program.
### Solution
We spent quite some time exploring and trying to use Unity Collaborate so we can merge the conflicts easily.
