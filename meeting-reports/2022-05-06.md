Time:  6 May, 2022, 20:00-20:40\
Participants: Joris LEFONDEUR, Yinghan LING\
Location: Online via Discord\
Documented by Yinghan LING.
## Progress
**Joris** designed all the departments, made the inventory that stored the Pokéballs, and linked the capture game to the NPCs, Pokédex and the inventory. He tested the game on the phone and found out that it lagged a lot in the Pokédex, but it ran well on the simulator on the PC. He has basically finished his part of the project so far. Besides, he shared the icon he made for the game, as follows:![icon](https://github.com/Group-2-SEP-2022/PokeProf/blob/master/meeting-reports/resources/icon.png)

**Yinghan**: as planned before, for the next week, Yinghan just needs to finish creating all the NPCs, the tile map, and some quests.

We will do more tests afterwards. Besides, if there's some time left, we will try to make the sound effect. According to our situation, we do not think that there's a problem about not being able to finish the program on time.

## Difficulties & Solutions
**Joris** found a bug where the number of the Pokéballs is not reduced even if one of them has already been used to capture the PokéProf. 
**Yinghan** solved it under some help. The bug lay in the C# script **`StartCapture.cs`**. Originally the object cannot be removed because the list is in a loop. The solution is to create another list and add the object we want to remove in it, then remove it after the loop.
