## Game Design
### Scope of the Game
We analyzed the requirements of our game, and discussed about the project in details. One of the major changes in our program is that we decreased its functionalities down to a smaller number. Originally in the game, the user needs to escape from the room, fight against the enemies to free the dean of FSTM. However, we re-evaluated the given time and the workload and found out that we might not be able to finish it. Therefore, we narrowed the game down to one main functionality: catching the Poképroves. It is a game similar to the game *Pokémon Go*, where the player can walk around and come into some Poképroves with Pokéballs. Once captured, the Poképroves will stay in the user's inventory. Their information, such as affiliation, research of specialty, can be read and displayed on the information board.

### Coding
- Our game will be an Android program on mobile phones. 
- We will use Unity as our game engine since it is powerful with abundant resources. 
- Programming language: C#.

### Graphical Problem
- We can use the external image for the movement functionality in Unity, we will generate our images with *Pixel Me* probably plus *Photoshop*. In this way, we are able to obtain our characters, the professors. Besides, the free sprites of Pokémon are available on [Pokémon Database](https://pokemondb.net/sprites)
- For Pokéballs, their sprites are also free online. 

- *TODO:* Confirm the usage of this game with Professor Müller. Will it be profitable?

## Project Management Tools
- Use the functionality *Project* on Github as a Kanban board.
- Set up a working branch and another one for backup functionalities on Github.
